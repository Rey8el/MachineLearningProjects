# Iris Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains code to perform Iris flower classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and is often used for educational purposes. 

## Introduction

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task is to predict the species of the iris flower based on these features. In this project, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to perform this classification task.
